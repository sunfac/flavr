  === REPLIT INSTRUCTION: Flavr+ Gating System (Final Version) ===

  Objective:
  Implement the official Flavr+ gating logic using a clean, persistent system that supports both guest and authenticated users. Replace any previous gating logic to avoid duplication or conflicts.

  üîê TRACKING METHOD:
  - Use a persistent **pseudo-user ID** for freemium users (e.g. via localStorage or fingerprint)
  - This ID should be created on first visit and stored client-side (fallback to cookies if needed)
  - Link this ID to backend-tracked monthly recipe generation count

  ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY REMINDER:
  Users may attempt to bypass limits by deleting cookies or localStorage.
  To reduce abuse:
    ‚Ä¢ Optionally fingerprint browser/device (e.g. user-agent hash + timezone + entropy)
    ‚Ä¢ Consider backend token throttling or detection logic if abuse becomes an issue
    ‚Ä¢ Optionally sync pseudo-user to IP logs (without storing PII)

  === OVERWRITE ALL EXISTING GATING LOGIC ===
  - Replace any existing recipe count, Flavr+ check, or feature visibility logic
  - Ensure no legacy conditionals interfere with the new gating system

  === ACCESS RULES ===

  ‚úÖ Free Users (pseudo ID or no login):
  - Access to full Zest features
  - 3 recipe generations per calendar month
  - No access to Flavr Rituals

  ‚úÖ Flavr+ Users (authenticated with hasFlavrPlus flag):
  - Unlimited generations
  - Full access to Flavr Rituals and any upcoming premium features

  === UI GATING BEHAVIOUR ===

  1. Show recipe counter badge: ‚ÄúYou have 1/3 free recipes left‚Äù
  2. On 3rd recipe, display final alert: ‚ÄúThis is your last recipe this month‚Äù
  3. On attempt to generate a 4th:
     - Block request
     - Show full-screen Flavr+ upgrade modal
     - Temporarily disable Zest chat, chips, and recipe buttons with tooltip overlay: ‚ÄúUnlock with Flavr+‚Äù

  === FLAVR RITUALS TAB ===
  - Always visible
  - For free users:
    ‚Ä¢ Blur content
    ‚Ä¢ CTA: ‚ÄúGet chef-crafted weekly plans with Flavr+‚Äù
    ‚Ä¢ Block any interaction

  === BACKEND SETUP ===
  - Track recipe generations per pseudo-user or authenticated user
  - Reset monthly count on the 1st of each month (automatically or on login)
  - Allow admin-level reset for testing/dev users

  === FINAL GOAL ===
  Give free users full exposure to the magic of Zest + recipe generation,
  while cleanly gating volume (not features) to drive meaningful upgrades to Flavr+.
