// OBJECTIVE:
// Retain existing Flavr landing page content structure and header — but dramatically elevate styling, clarity, and interactivity to match the premium, mobile-first, luxury tone of the rest of the app.

// PRESERVE:
// • Keep current logo/header exactly as is (no repositioning)
// • Maintain existing mode highlight sections and core messaging
• DO NOT REMOVE any board section or structural block — just refine them

// VISUAL ENHANCEMENTS:
// • Apply elite modern design:
  - Font: Use `Plus Jakarta Sans` or `Inter` — light/medium weights only
  - Buttons: Ghost or soft-glow buttons with subtle gradient on hover
  - Background: Deep charcoal gradient or blurred color fields (dark → warm fade)
  - Icons: Replace with Lucide (https://lucide.dev/icons) to keep consistency
• Use larger spacing and tighter layout control for high-end feel
• Make it feel like an Apple or Notion product site — clean, focused, classy

// CTA UPGRADE:
// • Add a central, animated CTA block mid-page (sticky on scroll for mobile if possible):
  - “Ready to cook with AI?”
  - Button: [ Start Now with Flavr ]
  - Subtext: “Your next meal starts with your mood, ingredients, and Zest.”

// ADD EMOTIONAL HOOK SECTIONS (without disrupting structure):
• Insert 1–2 emotion-driven micro-sections before the footer, such as:
  - “No more food waste. No more guesswork.”
  - “Chef-crafted meals. Pantry-level effort.”

// STICKY NAVIGATION UPGRADE:
// • Make the mode selector CTA (“Start Cooking”) appear on scroll past hero
• Allow users to tap/scroll into Shopping / Fridge / Chef mode flows directly from landing

// FOOTER:
// • Match login/auth UI
• Use soft-divided layout — logo + [Terms] [Privacy] [Instagram Icon]

// MOBILE:
// • Optimize all elements for mobile-first layout
• Enable swipe-to-mode and hero image scaling
• Avoid scroll jank by anchoring main CTAs above the fold

// OUTCOME:
// ✅ All existing landing content retained
✅ Header unchanged
✅ Stronger visual hierarchy + icon consistency
✅ Central “Start Now” CTA + emotional pull
✅ Modernized, mobile-optimized layout
✅ Consistent with Flavr branding and modal system
