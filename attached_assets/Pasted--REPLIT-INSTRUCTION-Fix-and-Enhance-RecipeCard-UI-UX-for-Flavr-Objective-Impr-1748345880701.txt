  === REPLIT INSTRUCTION: Fix and Enhance RecipeCard UI/UX for Flavr ===

  Objective:
  Improve the RecipeCard component to fix missing UI elements and optimise layout for mobile users. Ensure full integration with the existing floating Zest chatbot and resolve visual/component mounting issues.

  Context:
  The save and share components have already been created (e.g. `RecipeShareTools` and save button), but they are currently **not displaying** on the RecipeCard. These need to be correctly mounted and styled.

  Required Fixes and Enhancements:

  1. ✅ Debug and Display Save + Share Features
     - Ensure the existing save and share components are correctly imported and rendered within the RecipeCard.
     - Check conditional rendering logic — confirm that they are not hidden due to missing recipe ID, user session, or visibility checks.
     - Position save/share tools near the bottom of the card, but **not overlapping the floating chatbot**.
     - Share should use `/api/recipe/:id/share` and include copy-to-clipboard, print, and share link.
     - Save should persist the recipe to user history.

  2. 📱 Improve Ingredient List Layout
     - Optimise for mobile view:
       - Use smaller font size and line spacing
       - Use a scrollable or 2-column layout for long lists
       - Optionally group by type (“For the sauce”, “For the base”, etc.)

  3. 🔁 Add Substitution Icon for Each Ingredient
     - Add a small “Substitute” icon (🔄) next to each ingredient
     - On click, trigger the **floating Zest chatbot popup** with a pre-filled message like:
       “Suggest a substitution for [ingredient]”
     - Ensure the chatbot opens automatically with that message populated in the input

  4. ❌ Remove Ingredient Crossout/Radio Feature
     - Remove the cross-out radio/tick buttons from the ingredients list
     - They are unnecessary and create visual clutter on mobile

  5. 🖼 Enlarge Recipe Image
     - Slightly increase the size of the main recipe image
     - Keep it responsive and prevent layout shifts
     - Add padding or subtle shadow if needed to improve visual impact

  6. 💬 Integrate with Floating Zest Chatbot
     - Do not embed chat inside the RecipeCard
     - All interactions (like ingredient substitutions) should route through the floating Zest popup
     - Ensure only one chat instance appears at a time and that it’s tied to the current recipe context

  7. 🧪 Optional Styling Enhancements
     - Add hover/tap animations for save and share icons
     - Use toasts for actions like “Copied!”, “Saved to your recipes”, etc.
     - Apply Tailwind or styled-components for responsive spacing

  Deliverable:
  RecipeCard should:
  - Correctly display the already-built save/share tools
  - Be fully mobile-optimised
  - Offer smart ingredient substitution via Zest
  - Integrate visually and functionally with Flavr’s overall experience
