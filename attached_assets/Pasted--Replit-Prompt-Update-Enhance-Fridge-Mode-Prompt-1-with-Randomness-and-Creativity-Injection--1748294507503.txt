// Replit Prompt Update — Enhance Fridge Mode Prompt 1 with Randomness and Creativity Injection

// OBJECTIVE:
// Without altering any existing Fridge Mode logic or prompt structure,
// this update appends two variation-enhancing elements to Fridge Mode’s Prompt 1:
// 1. A dynamic `variationSeed` for structural uniqueness
// 2. A randomly selected `creativeInstruction` tailored to “use-what-you-have” fridge cooking
// These additions should be inserted **verbatim** at the end of the current Prompt 1 for Fridge Mode,
// immediately before calling the GPT model.

// DO NOT remove or modify any existing inputs, quiz mappings, or structure.
// This update is additive and must retain current behavior and formatting.


// STEP 1 — Add this curated set of `creativeInstructions` specific to Fridge Mode:

const creativeInstructions = [
  "Prioritize minimizing waste — make sure all ingredients are used thoughtfully.",
  "Find clever ways to elevate simple, mismatched ingredients.",
  "Use pantry staples to tie leftover ingredients together.",
  "Suggest bold flavors or sauces that can unify disparate fridge items.",
  "Think of global comfort foods that are flexible — stir fries, stews, or frittatas.",
  "Create dishes that could be prepped in one pan or tray.",
  "Highlight make-ahead versatility or batch-cooking value.",
  "Turn odds and ends into something impressive with pro technique.",
  "Keep it simple but surprising — use pickling, roasting, or toasting for impact.",
  "Avoid recipes that rely on ingredients not likely to be on hand."
];


// STEP 2 — Randomize instruction + create variationSeed when Prompt 1 runs:

const randomInstruction = creativeInstructions[Math.floor(Math.random() * creativeInstructions.length)];
const variationSeed = `fridge-${Date.now()}-${Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000)}`;


// STEP 3 — Inject the following lines VERBATIM at the bottom of the existing Fridge Mode Prompt 1 string:

prompt += `\n\nCreative Direction: ${randomInstruction}`;
prompt += `\nSeed for creative variation (not visible to user): ${variationSeed}`;


// OUTCOME:
// ✅ Retains all current quiz input logic and formatting
// ✅ Adds GPT-prompted creativity within Fridge context (no waste, high flavor, practical ideas)
// ✅ Structural randomness prevents recipe repetition for same input
// ✅ Final prompt remains mode-isolated, coherent, and optimized
