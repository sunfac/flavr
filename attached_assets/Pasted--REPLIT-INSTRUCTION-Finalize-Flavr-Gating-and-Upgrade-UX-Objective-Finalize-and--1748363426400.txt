  === REPLIT INSTRUCTION: Finalize Flavr+ Gating and Upgrade UX ===

  Objective:
  Finalize and polish the Flavr+ subscription logic, model handling, UI messaging, and upgrade flow. Ensure free users are capped fairly while seeing the full value of Flavr+, and direct them to upgrade paths with clear benefit messaging and minimal friction.

  === USER ACCESS LOGIC ===

  ✅ Free Users (unauthenticated or no Flavr+):
  - Can generate up to 3 full recipes per calendar month
  - Can access full functionality per recipe (Zest chatbot, recipe editing, Stable Diffusion image generation)
  - Cannot access Flavr Rituals
  - After hitting cap, must upgrade to Flavr+ to generate more recipes

  ✅ Flavr+ Users (user.hasFlavrPlus === true):
  - Unlimited recipe generations
  - GPT-4 Turbo model used for all recipes + Zest chat
  - DALL·E used for recipe images
  - Full access to Flavr Rituals and any new premium features

  === MODEL LOGIC ===

  - Use GPT-3.5 Turbo for free users
  - Use GPT-4 Turbo for Flavr+ users
  - Use Stable Diffusion for all image generation (both free and premium)
  - Upgrade to DALL·E for Flavr+ users where available

  === UI + UX CHANGES ===

  1. ✅ Header Navigation
     - Add a “Flavr+” button to the main site header (top nav) linking to `/flavr-plus`
     - Style consistently with CTA buttons (e.g. bold outline or orange accent)

  2. ✅ Hamburger Menu
     - Already contains a Flavr+ link — no changes needed

  3. ✅ Landing Page CTA
     - Already includes a Flavr+ upgrade button — confirm it links to `/flavr-plus`

  4. 🔒 Gating Behavior After Cap Reached
     - On 4th recipe attempt for free user:
       • Block generation
       • Show a modal-style signup popup
       • Include Flavr+ pricing and benefits clearly:
         - Headline: “You’ve reached your free recipe limit”
         - Subtitle: “Unlock unlimited recipes, GPT-4 Turbo, weekly meal plans, and stunning recipe images”
         - Pricing tier (e.g. “Only £4.99/month” or use Stripe tier)
         - CTA Button: “Upgrade to Flavr+”
       • Disable generation buttons and chatbot interactions unless upgraded
       • Optional: Fade or blur UI behind modal for clarity

  5. 🚪 Flavr Rituals
     - Tab should be visible to all users
     - For free users:
       • Blur content
       • Overlay: “Flavr Rituals are exclusive to Flavr+”
       • CTA: “Upgrade for weekly meal plans”

  === FINAL GOAL ===

  Provide full recipe power to free users with a natural upgrade moment after 3 generations.  
  Visually promote Flavr+ across header, menu, and landing.  
  Ensure upgrade flow is clean, persuasive, and fully integrated across the experience.
