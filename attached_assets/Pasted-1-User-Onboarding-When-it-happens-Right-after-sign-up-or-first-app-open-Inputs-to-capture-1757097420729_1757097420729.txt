1. User Onboarding
	•	When it happens: Right after sign-up (or first app open).
	•	Inputs to capture:
	•	Household size (adults/kids).
	•	Dietary needs (allergies, vegetarian, halal, etc.).
	•	Cooking frequency (e.g. 2, 4, 6 dinners/week).
	•	Time comfort (weeknight max: 20–30 min, weekend OK: 45–60 min).
	•	Ambition slider (Quick & Simple → Experimental & Creative).
	•	Storage: Persist in user profile → feeds into every plan.
	•	Adjustment: Always editable in Settings → Preferences.

2. Plan Customisation
	•	Default: Every Sunday, Flavr generates a plan based on saved prefs.
	•	User control:
	•	Accept (1-tap lock-in).
	•	Adjust (swap 1–2 recipes, re-roll cuisines).
	•	Skip (give reason: leftovers, eating out, busy week).
	•	Constraints available:
	•	Cuisine weighting (e.g. 40% Italian, 20% Asian, 20% British, 20% Wild Card).
	•	Cooking time filters (e.g. max 30 mins Mon–Thu, free at weekends).
	•	Budget per serving (only editable in Flavr+).
	•	Balance: Core weekly plan is mostly auto-pilot; deeper control lives in Flavr+.

3. Integration Points
	•	Shopping Mode:
	•	Weekly plan auto-exports to a consolidated shopping list (grouped by aisle).
	•	SmartList v1 builds on existing Shopping Mode output → no duplicate logic.
	•	Fridge Mode:
	•	If user skips a meal, Flavr prompts: “Want me to rescue with what’s in the fridge?”
	•	Uses same backend, but in reverse: Fridge → Recipe Rescue → logs into weekly plan.
	•	Consistency: All recipes (weekly, fridge, ad-hoc) share same card format, storage, and save/share flow.

Your Question: Should we start with Sunday auto-generation + plan interface?

Yes. That’s the keystone feature. Without it, there’s no ritual, no accountability, no repeat logins. It’s where Gousto-like stickiness begins.
