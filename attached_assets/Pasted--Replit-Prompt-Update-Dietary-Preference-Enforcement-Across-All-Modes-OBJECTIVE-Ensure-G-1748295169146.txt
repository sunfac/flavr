// Replit Prompt Update — Dietary Preference Enforcement Across All Modes

// OBJECTIVE:
// Ensure GPT consistently respects user-selected dietary preferences (e.g. vegetarian, vegan) in all recipe generation modes.
// This update applies globally to Shopping Mode, Fridge Mode, and Chef Assist Mode Prompt 2 — wherever recipes are generated.

// DO NOT alter or remove any existing prompt structure, variables, formatting, or injected text.
// This update is strictly additive. Inject the following enforcement logic into the final constructed prompt string after ${dietaryText} has been mapped.

// STEP 1 — Add explicit directive to the GPT prompt to reinforce dietary compliance:

const strictDietaryInstruction = `
Important: The user has specific dietary preferences that must be respected without exception.

If the user selected "Vegetarian", do not include any meat, poultry, or seafood in the recipe. You may include plant-based proteins, dairy, or eggs.

If the user selected "Vegan", do not include any meat, poultry, seafood, dairy, eggs, or animal-derived products.

Do not suggest substitutions that violate these preferences. If a recipe traditionally contains meat or dairy, provide a suitable plant-based alternative.

These constraints are non-negotiable and should influence ingredient selection, recipe structure, and cooking techniques.
`;

// STEP 2 — Inject this string VERBATIM into all final prompt strings after ${dietaryText}, like so:

prompt += `\n${dietaryText}`;
prompt += `\n${strictDietaryInstruction}`;

// STEP 3 — Ensure this injection occurs in:
// - Shopping Mode Prompt 1
// - Shopping Mode Prompt 2
// - Fridge Mode Prompt 1
// - Fridge Mode Prompt 2
// - Chef Assist Prompt 2

// DO NOT add this to prompts that do not include dietary input.
// DO NOT override or alter the existing ${dietaryText} construction logic or remove any part of the existing prompt string.

// OUTCOME:
// ✅ GPT will explicitly be told to avoid meat/dairy/fish in vegetarian/vegan modes
// ✅ Recipes will respect the user's intent
// ✅ Prompt integrity, formatting, and creativity are preserved
// ✅ This logic is consistent across all modes using dietary input
