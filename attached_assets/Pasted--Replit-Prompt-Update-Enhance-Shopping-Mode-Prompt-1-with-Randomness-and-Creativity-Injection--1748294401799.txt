// Replit Prompt Update — Enhance Shopping Mode Prompt 1 with Randomness and Creativity Injection

// OBJECTIVE:
// Without changing any existing functionality or rewriting the current Shopping Mode Prompt 1 structure,
// this update adds two improvements to increase creative variation:
// 1. A `variationSeed` to encourage unique GPT completions
// 2. A randomly selected `creativeInstruction` from a curated list
// These will be injected into the prompt body **verbatim** and passed to GPT during recipe generation.

// DO NOT remove or modify the existing prompt structure — simply append the following content
// to the bottom of the current prompt for Shopping Mode Prompt 1.


// STEP 1 — Add the following `creativeInstructions` array somewhere accessible (above or outside the prompt):

const creativeInstructions = [
  "Add international influence — pull from Asian, Mediterranean or Latin American inspiration.",
  "Emphasize seasonal ingredients and vibrant colors.",
  "Focus on textural contrast — include crunch, creaminess, or char.",
  "Use unexpected pairings — like fruit with spice or sweet with umami.",
  "Think like a street food chef — punchy, bold, and fun.",
  "Simplify technique — one pot or traybake encouraged.",
  "Create meals that feel comforting and nostalgic.",
  "Modernize a classic recipe with a surprising twist.",
  "Use fresh herbs, acid, and fat to create depth.",
  "Make it visually Instagrammable with color contrast and plating."
];


// STEP 2 — Generate a random instruction and variationSeed each time Prompt 1 is run:

const randomInstruction = creativeInstructions[Math.floor(Math.random() * creativeInstructions.length)];
const variationSeed = `seed-${Date.now()}-${Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000)}`;


// STEP 3 — Inject the following lines VERBATIM into the end of the existing Shopping Mode Prompt 1,
// immediately before the GPT is called:

prompt += `\n\nCreative Direction: ${randomInstruction}`;
prompt += `\nSeed for creative variation (not visible to user): ${variationSeed}`;


// OUTCOME:
// ✅ Prompts become structurally unique (via variationSeed)
// ✅ GPT output becomes more diverse, fun, and flavour-driven (via creativeInstruction)
// ✅ All current inputs, formatting, and behavior remain unchanged
// ✅ Prompt 1 suggestions will feel fresher and less repetitive
