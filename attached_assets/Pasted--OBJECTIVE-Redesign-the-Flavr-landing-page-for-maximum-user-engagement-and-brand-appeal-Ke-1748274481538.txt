// OBJECTIVE:
// Redesign the Flavr landing page for maximum user engagement and brand appeal.
// Keep the existing header as-is, but replace all body content with modern, emotionally engaging copy, layout, and visuals.
// Use new fonts, improve structure, and add a dedicated Flavr+ section.

// BRANDING AND FONTS:
// • Use premium, modern UI fonts — suggested:
//   - Primary: `Plus Jakarta Sans`, `DM Sans`, or `Inter`
//   - Weight: Medium + Semibold
// • Match overall theme to rest of app: dark gradient background, orange accents, glowing buttons, Lucide icons

// CONTENT STRUCTURE (NEW SECTIONS):
1. **Hero Section**
   - Bold headline: “Your Private AI Chef. One Chat Away.”
   - Subheadline: “Flavr creates bespoke meals based on your mood, ingredients, and ambition.”
   - Button: [ Start Cooking Now ]
   - Add optional microtext: “No logins, no waste, just smarter cooking.”

2. **How It Works**
   - Three Lucide icon cards:
     - `bot`: “Meet Zest” → Chat-based AI that adapts to you
     - `fridge`: “Use what you have” → Zero-waste fridge cooking
     - `shopping-cart`: “Smart shopping” → Full lists, perfect pairings

3. **Flavr+ Section**
   - Title: “Unlock Flavr+”
   - Features:
     - Unlimited recipe generations
     - Weekly chef-curated drops
     - Bonus chat packs & wine pairing mode
     - Early access to Flavr Rituals (meal planner)
   - CTA Button: [ Upgrade to Flavr+ ]
   - Soft-glow background card style (like login modal)

4. **Testimonials or Quote Wall (Optional)**
   - 2–3 quotes with stars or emoji icons
   - “Game changer for my weekly dinners.” — Jess
   - “Finally stopped wasting my fridge food.” — Tom

5. **Final CTA Block**
   - Line: “Ditch the guesswork. Cook with Zest.”
   - Button: [ Start Your First Recipe ]
   - Subline: “It only takes one ingredient and your vibe.”

// VISUAL AND STYLE INSTRUCTIONS:
