UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSPIRE ME BUTTON (GPT-5, WITH SEED VARIATIONS)

Goal
Return a single, high-quality, cookbook-style title in ~1–3 seconds that STILL reflects our seed variation system. This only updates Inspire Me. Chef Assist remains unchanged.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) RUNTIME (FAST PATH)
• model: "gpt-5"
• randomness: 0.95        // replaces temperature in GPT-5
• top_p: 0.95
• verbosity: "low"
• max_output_tokens: 30–40
• Always send a fresh system + user message (no chat backlog).

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) SEED VARIATION (LIGHTWEIGHT, DETERMINISTIC)
Use the SAME seed inputs as Chef Assist, but map them to title-friendly cues (no jargon, no heavy reasoning).

Inputs available:
  randomSeed:int, complexityLevel:1–15, simpleStyle:1–15, creativityMode:1–8,
  seasonalFocus:1–6, textureTheme:1–10, flavorProfile:1–12
Optional inputs (if present): dietaryMode ("omnivore" default | "vegetarian" | "vegan")

Deterministic selection:
  userIntentHash = hash(lowercase(user_intent_or_dish || ""))
  sessionSalt    = hash(clientId||deviceId||userId) XOR hash(epochDay)
  rngSeed        = randomSeed XOR userIntentHash XOR sessionSalt
  idx = PRNG(rngSeed) % length

Title cue pools (plain-English, title-safe, no chef jargon):

A) techniqueCue[15]  // pick 1 (mapped from complexityLevel)
["slow-braised","pan-seared","oven-roasted","grilled","crispy-fried",
 "steam-kissed","gently poached","buttery","sheet-pan","pressure-braised",
 "confited","low-and-slow","smoky-rubbed","hand-tossed","quick-cured"] 
// If simplicity == "≤30-min", force techniqueCue ∈ {"pan-seared","oven-roasted","sheet-pan","grilled"}

B) seasonCue[6]      // pick 0–1 (mapped from seasonalFocus)
["spring herb","summer","autumn","winter","light roast","all-season"]
// If "all-season", omit from title.

C) textureCue[10]    // pick 0–1 (mapped from textureTheme)
["crispy","silky","tender","crackling","sticky-glaze","char-edged",
 "crumb-crusted","brothy","airy","flaky"]

D) flavourCue[12]    // pick 1 (mapped from flavorProfile)
["umami-rich","citrus-bright","herb-lifted","nutty","aromatic-spiced",
 "garlicky","sweet-savory","smoky","pickled-accent","fermented-note",
 "peppery","chilli-warm"]
// If dietaryMode is child-friendly, avoid “chilli-warm”; use “herb-lifted” instead.

E) proteinPool (choose 1 deterministically; override with user intent if provided)
omnivore: ["chicken","salmon","cod","prawns","beef","pork","lamb"]
vegetarian: ["mushrooms","aubergine","halloumi","cauliflower","chickpeas"]
vegan: ["mushrooms","aubergine","cauliflower","chickpeas","butternut squash"]

Composition rule:
• Title = [optional seasonCue] [techniqueCue] [protein] with [flavourCue or textureCue]
• Keep to 4–10 words. Don’t include more than one optional cue beyond flavour/technique.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) TITLE POLICY (STRICT)
• 4–10 words, appetising, believable for a cookbook/restaurant.
• Must name the main protein/hero ingredient.
• EXACTLY ONE playful descriptor is allowed, but it must be plain-English and non-technical (e.g., “char-kissed”, “golden”, “smoky”, “crisped”, “velvet” style words). 
• BLOCKLIST (never use): ["Maillard","sous-vide","gastrique","espuma","spherification","nitro","transglutaminase","molecular"]
• No emoji, brand names, or slashes. No chef-science jargon.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) PROMPT USED FOR GPT-5 (LIGHTWEIGHT)

SYSTEM:
"You create memorable, cookbook-style recipe titles for home cooks. Titles are short, plain-English, appetising, and reflect the given cues. Avoid chef-science terms and banned words. Output exactly one title, no extra text."

USER (fill placeholders from Section 2 after applying the quick guardrails):
"Generate ONE unique recipe title that matches these cues:
• technique: {{techniqueCue}}
• flavour: {{flavourCue}}
• protein: {{protein}}
• optional season cue (use only if not 'all-season'): {{seasonCue_or_empty}}
• optional texture cue (use at most one): {{textureCue_or_empty}}
Rules:
• 4–10 words, cookbook/restaurant tone.
• Include the protein clearly.
• Use only plain-English descriptors; avoid technical or chef-science words.
• Do not use: Maillard, sous-vide, gastrique, espuma, spherification, nitro, transglutaminase, molecular.
Output: the title only (no quotes, no punctuation at the start or end, no explanations)."

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) OUTPUT & WIRING
• Return a single line of plain text (the title). 
• Immediately place it into the Chef Assist input box.
• If parsing adds quotes or trailing punctuation, strip them.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6) SPEED NOTES
• Keep max_output_tokens at 30–40 and verbosity "low".
• Do not include previous chat history.
• Do not send seed arrays or long explanations—only the resolved cues.
• If latency >3s in production, drop flavourCue synonyms that are long; prefer shorter ones (e.g., “herb-lifted” → “herby”).

This preserves seed-driven variety, blocks chef jargon (no “Maillard”), and keeps Inspire Me fast and cookbook-realistic.
