âœ… MODERNIZATION STRATEGY
	1.	Use an Elite UI Framework
	â€¢	Replace or enhance raw Tailwind/styling with a premium React component system:
	â€¢	Recommended: Radix UI, ShadCN UI, or Tailwind UI Pro
	â€¢	This will give you:
	â€¢	Animated menus
	â€¢	Beautiful toggle switches
	â€¢	Drop-in modals, tooltips, tabs, dropdowns
	â€¢	Better theming control (dark/light mode, accent colors)
	2.	Revamp Button & Form Styling
	â€¢	Create a unified design language for:
	â€¢	Primary CTA buttons: bold, rounded, animated hover states
	â€¢	Secondary buttons: clean, minimal
	â€¢	Form inputs: smooth labels, floating placeholders, tactile feel
	â€¢	Use micro-interactions (e.g., bounce, glow) for feedback
	3.	Psychological Color Palette
	â€¢	Use color to trigger emotion and engagement:
	â€¢	Primary: dopamine-inducing coral or golden amber
	â€¢	Accent: soft electric teal or dopamine blue (trust, energy)
	â€¢	Backgrounds: neutral off-whites, charcoal gradients
	â€¢	Use subtle gradients and blur glass effects for polish
	â€¢	Theme must be lightweight, joyful, and confidence-boosting
	4.	Modern Fonts + Iconography
	â€¢	Replace current fonts with:
	â€¢	Inter, Space Grotesk, or General Sans
	â€¢	Ensure mobile legibility and clear hierarchy
	â€¢	Use a cohesive icon system:
	â€¢	Use Lucide, Phosphor Icons, or Heroicons v2
	â€¢	Avoid Google Material Icons (dated)
	â€¢	Icons should be consistent weight, slightly rounded, not overused
	5.	Navigation & Menu Styling
	â€¢	Redesign the menu to feel:
	â€¢	Minimal
	â€¢	Overlay-style
	â€¢	Swipeable on mobile
	â€¢	Animate with slide/fade/glow effects
	â€¢	Make buttons feel tap-friendly (48px+ min height)
	6.	Brand Expression
	â€¢	Ensure that the app feels like a lifestyle product, not a tool
	â€¢	Elevate visuals with:
	â€¢	Clean illustrations (e.g., undraw.co or custom SVG)
	â€¢	Gradient backgrounds in CTAs
	â€¢	Subtle drop shadows for elevation
