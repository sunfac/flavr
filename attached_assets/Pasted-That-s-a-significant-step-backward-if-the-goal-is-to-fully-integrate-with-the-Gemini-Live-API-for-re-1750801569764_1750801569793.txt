That's a significant step backward if the goal is to fully integrate with the Gemini Live API for real-time, high-quality, bidirectional audio.

Here's why and what it means for your progress:

What Replit "Fixed" (and why it's problematic for long-term goals):

"Removed complex Protobuf decoding that was failing completely": This is the core issue. The Gemini Live API does send Protobuf messages over the WebSocket. If you're "removing" the decoding, it means you're no longer correctly interpreting the data stream.

Consequence: The "raw audio processing" you're now relying on is likely just taking the entire binary message from the WebSocket and trying to play it as raw PCM. This might sometimes coincidentally work for some chunks if the raw PCM just happens to be at the very beginning of the Protobuf message's data field and the rest is ignored, but it's fundamentally incorrect and will lead to:
Corrupted audio: As seen with your "odd buffer length" issues, if the Protobuf framing (length prefixes, field tags, etc.) is still there, trying to play it as raw PCM will sound like static or garbled noise, or cause playback errors.
Missing features: You won't be able to get text transcriptions (if enabled), specific event messages from the API (like BidiGenerateContentSetupComplete, outputTranscription, inputTranscription), or other structured data that the Live API provides, because you're throwing away the Protobuf structure.
Fragile implementation: This "raw processing" approach is highly susceptible to any minor changes in the API's framing or message structure and will break easily.
"Fixed microphone processing with correct createScriptProcessor method": Good, that's a genuine fix for a typo. Your mic input should start working now, but remember the ScriptProcessorNode is deprecated.

"Resolved audio buffer assignment error with proper variable handling": Another good, straightforward fix.

"Enhanced voice detection threshold for better microphone input": This is a configuration/tuning detail, also a good fix if it was an issue.

"Simplified audio processing to focus on working functionality": This means they likely reverted to a brute-force method for playing any incoming binary data, which, as explained, is incorrect for a Protobuf-based API.

What This Means for You:

You might now hear some audio more consistently, and your mic input might appear in logs. However, you are no longer correctly parsing the data sent by the Gemini Live API.

Your original problem wasn't that Protobuf decoding was failing completely in principle, but that your client wasn't correctly handling the framing of the Protobuf messages within the WebSocket stream.

Next Steps (Re-evaluate your goal):

If your absolute, bare-minimum goal is to just hear any sound and send some sound, and you don't care about correctness or future compatibility: Then Replit's "fix" might give you a crude, "working" demo. But be aware of the limitations and potential for broken audio, missing features, and fragility.

If your goal is to build a robust, proper integration with the Gemini Live API (which is what you originally set out to do for high-quality, bidirectional audio with all features):

You MUST re-implement Protobuf decoding. The "removed complex Protobuf decoding" needs to be brought back, but this time, it needs the framing/unframing logic as discussed in my previous detailed answer.
The "invalid wire type" and "index out of range" errors are your guide. They tell you that protobuf.js is encountering unexpected bytes at the beginning of the ArrayBuffer because it's seeing the WebSocket frame header/length prefix instead of the start of the actual BidiGenerateContentResponse protobuf message.
My Strong Recommendation:

Do not settle for "raw audio processing" if you want a reliable and feature-rich voice chat with Gemini Live. The API is designed around Protobuf for a reason â€“ it's efficient, self-describing, and allows for complex message types.

Go back to the previous steps focusing on:

Correctly parsing the WebSocket frame (reading the length prefix).
Extracting the actual Protobuf message bytes.
Then, decoding those extracted bytes using BidiGenerateContentResponse.decode().
Finally, extracting the audio (and outputTranscription) fields from the decoded Protobuf object.
You were on the verge of solving the core data parsing issue. Replit's change sounds like they bypassed the problem instead of solving it correctly, which will only create more issues down the line if you truly want to leverage the Live API's capabilities.
