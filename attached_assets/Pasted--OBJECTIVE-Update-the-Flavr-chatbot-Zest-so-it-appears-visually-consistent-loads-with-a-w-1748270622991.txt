// OBJECTIVE:
// Update the Flavr chatbot ("Zest") so it appears visually consistent, loads with a welcoming opening bubble, and functions as:
// 1. A dynamic recipe editor (updates recipe steps or ingredients in real-time)
// 2. A conversational cooking assistant
// 3. A mobile-optimized, visually premium floating chat UI

// DESIGN INSTRUCTIONS:
// • Match styling to the Auth Modal and general Flavr theme (use same rounded corners, shadow, font, blur layer, glowing buttons)
// • Ensure Zest opens with:
//   → Initial greeting bubble: "Let’s cook something unforgettable. What do you feel like today?"
// • Position Zest in the lower right on desktop and float-in from the bottom on mobile
// • Auto-expand when a user starts interacting with a recipe (or clicks the chat icon)
// • Ensure the chat container does not block recipe content (use semi-transparent or collapsible styles)

// FUNCTIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
// • Enable Zest to handle:
  - Recipe improvements (e.g., “make it spicier,” “double it for 4 people,” “swap chicken for tofu”)
  - Ingredient substitutions
  - Cooking time or method changes
  - Side suggestions or wine pairings
• Allow GPT to dynamically update the visible recipe card using current output (Prompt 2) + change logic
• Use chips above the input bar for:
  - [ Make it spicier ]
  - [ Bigger portions ]
  - [ Add a side ]
  - [ Substitute ingredient ]
  - [ Change cooking method ]
  - [ Wine pairing ]
• Clicking a chip should automatically send that intent to GPT with recipe context

// TECH INTEGRATION:
// • Ensure all recipe context (Prompt 2) is passed to Zest so it can adjust dynamically
• Append any edits Zest makes directly into the recipe card displayed
• Store a running history of chat interactions in session storage for context continuity

// BUG FIX:
// • Currently the chatbot is cut off and not styled — fix the container width, height, and background
• Make input bar sticky, ensure buttons are not cut off on smaller screens

// OUTCOME:
// ✅ A premium, consistent chatbot with full conversational ability
✅ Real-time recipe editing powered by GPT
✅ Mobile-optimized and visually cohesive
✅ Opening line to guide users into interaction
✅ Quick edit chips to encourage repeat engagement
