Please enhance the Flavr app‚Äôs navigation to create a smooth, intuitive experience that guides users from landing through to mode selection and recipe generation, with a consistent, polished design inspired by Apple-level usability.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ NAVIGATION IMPROVEMENTS TO IMPLEMENT
	1.	From Landing Page to Mode Selection
	‚Ä¢	On the landing page (/), prominently feature a large CTA button:
	‚Ä¢	Label: ‚ÄúAsk the AI Chef‚Äù or ‚ÄúStart Cooking with Flavr‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	When clicked, navigate the user to the mode selector page at /app
	‚Ä¢	Use smooth scrolling or route transitions for visual polish
	2.	Mode Selection Page (/app)
	‚Ä¢	Clearly display all three modes with friendly, tappable cards:
	‚Ä¢	üõí Shopping Mode
	‚Ä¢	ü•¶ Fridge to Fork Mode
	‚Ä¢	üë®‚Äçüç≥ Chef Assist Mode
	‚Ä¢	Each mode card should include:
	‚Ä¢	A short description
	‚Ä¢	Visual/icon
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúStart‚Äù button that takes user into the quiz for that mode
	3.	Global Site-Wide Navigation
	‚Ä¢	Add a clean, consistent navigation menu accessible from all pages:
	‚Ä¢	Apple-style top-right hamburger or icon menu
	‚Ä¢	Menu options:
	‚Ä¢	Home
	‚Ä¢	Choose a Mode
	‚Ä¢	My Recipes / History
	‚Ä¢	Settings
	‚Ä¢	Flavr+
	‚Ä¢	Make sure it‚Äôs responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop) and polished
	‚Ä¢	Use smooth slide-in animation or modal dropdown
	‚Ä¢	Optional: fixed bottom tab bar on mobile for instant access to ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúChat‚Äù, ‚ÄúModes‚Äù, and ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù
	4.	Persistent Mode Awareness
	‚Ä¢	Highlight the current active mode in the nav bar or header
	‚Ä¢	Optionally show breadcrumb trail: e.g., Home > Shopping > Recipe
	5.	Styling Goals
	‚Ä¢	Prioritize simplicity, hierarchy, and white space
	‚Ä¢	Transitions should feel fluid
	‚Ä¢	Keep color scheme and branding consistent with the Flavr identity
	‚Ä¢	Apply Apple-like design principles: intuitive, minimal, delightful

‚∏ª

üß† TECH CONSIDERATIONS
	‚Ä¢	Use React Router for navigation
	‚Ä¢	Use useLocation or similar hook to track active route
	‚Ä¢	Header should conditionally hide/show ‚ÄúBack‚Äù or ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù based on screen
	‚Ä¢	Make sure navigation does not interrupt in-progress quizzes or chat
	‚Ä¢	Apply lazy loading if needed to preserve performance across transitions

‚∏ª

Once implemented, navigation should feel seamless, obvious, and enjoyable ‚Äî guiding users through the experience from curiosity to creation, just like exploring a beautifully designed Apple app. Let me know when it‚Äôs complete for UX review.
