// Replit Prompt — Add “Did You Know?” Fact Scroller While Waiting for Recipe Output

// GOAL:
// Create a polished, looping “Did You Know?” facts section to display while the user waits for recipe generation or Stable Diffusion image rendering.
// This enhances perceived performance and keeps users engaged with entertaining, informative food facts.
// It should rotate facts every 4 seconds, styled consistently with Flavr branding, and appear below any loading spinner or chatbot bubble.

// INSTRUCTIONS:
// 1. Add the following component to your app, ideally displayed between the loading state and final recipe card.
// 2. This version includes 30 interesting food and cooking facts to loop indefinitely.
