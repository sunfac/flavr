FLAVOR MAXIMIZATION MANDATE - PROFESSIONAL CULINARY EXCELLENCE:

**FUNDAMENTAL TECHNIQUE PRIORITIES:**
1. **MAILLARD REACTION MASTERY**: Always specify proper browning techniques for proteins and aromatics
   - Sear proteins at high heat before finishing
   - Brown onions, garlic, and spices to develop deep flavors
   - Use proper pan temperature and don't overcrowd

2. **LAYERED SEASONING STRATEGY**: Season at multiple stages, not just at the end
   - Season proteins before cooking for penetration
   - Season vegetables as they cook to build flavor layers  
   - Finish with flaky salt or acid to brighten completed dishes

3. **UMAMI DEPTH BUILDING**: Include umami-rich elements for savory satisfaction
   - Use stocks instead of water for cooking grains/vegetables
   - Add aged cheeses, mushrooms, tomato paste, or anchovy fillets
   - Include fermented elements like soy sauce, miso, or aged vinegars

4. **ACID BALANCE TECHNIQUE**: Always include acidic elements for flavor brightness
   - Finish dishes with lemon juice, vinegar, or wine reduction
   - Use citrus zests for aromatic lift without overwhelming acidity
   - Balance rich/fatty elements with bright acid counterpoints

5. **FAT FOR FLAVOR TRANSPORT**: Use fats strategically for mouthfeel and flavor carrying
   - Use compound butters for finishing meats and vegetables
   - Infuse oils with herbs/spices during cooking
   - Add richness through proper rendered fats or high-quality oils

**ADVANCED FLAVOR DEVELOPMENT TECHNIQUES:**
- **Caramelization**: Brown vegetables and fruits to develop natural sweetness
- **Reduction**: Concentrate liquids to intensify flavors (wine, stocks, fruit juices)
- **Blooming Spices**: Toast whole spices in dry pan or oil to release essential oils
- **Deglazing**: Use liquid to capture fond from pans for instant flavor base
- **Resting**: Allow cooked proteins to rest so juices redistribute for maximum flavor
- **Temperature Control**: Cook at proper temperatures to develop flavors without destroying them

**INGREDIENT SELECTION FOR MAXIMUM IMPACT:**
- Choose ingredients at peak ripeness/quality for best flavor development
- Combine complementary flavors within same cuisine family
- Use fresh herbs at finish, dried herbs during cooking
- Select cooking methods that enhance rather than mask ingredient flavors
- Prefer ingredients with natural flavor intensity over bland alternatives

**PROFESSIONAL FINISHING TECHNIQUES:**
- Taste and adjust seasoning before serving
- Add fresh elements (herbs, citrus, quality oil) just before serving
- Use temperature contrast (warm dish with cool garnish) when appropriate
- Balance textures to enhance flavor perception (crispy, creamy, tender)
- Consider visual appeal as it affects flavor perception

EVERY RECIPE MUST demonstrate these techniques rather than just listing ingredients and basic instructions. Show the WHY behind each technique to maximize flavor development.

MANDATORY FLAVOR BALANCE ANALYSIS:
Every dish must achieve harmony between these elements:

**SWEETNESS SOURCES**: 
- Natural caramelization from proper browning techniques
- Roasted vegetables for concentrated natural sugars
- Quality ingredients at peak ripeness
- Reduction of natural fruit juices or wine
- Caramelized onions or shallots as base

**ACIDITY SOURCES**:
- Fresh citrus juice or zest for brightness
- Quality vinegars (balsamic, sherry, red wine, rice)
- Wine reductions or deglazing liquids
- Fermented elements (pickles, fermented vegetables)
- Fresh tomatoes or tomato-based elements

**SALT/UMAMI DEPTH**:
- Proper seasoning at multiple cooking stages
- Umami-rich ingredients (aged cheese, mushrooms, anchovies)
- Quality stocks instead of water for cooking
- Fermented elements (soy sauce, miso, fish sauce)
- Cured meats or aged ingredients where appropriate

**FAT/RICHNESS**:
- High-quality cooking oils for flavor and mouthfeel
- Compound butters for finishing
- Natural fats from proteins or nuts
- Cream or coconut milk for richness when appropriate
- Olive oil or other finishing oils

**AROMATIC ELEMENTS**:
- Fresh herbs added at proper timing (hardy herbs during cooking, delicate herbs at finish)
- Toasted spices and properly bloomed aromatics
- Garlic and onion family properly developed
- Citrus zest for aromatic lift
- Quality vanilla, extracts, or aromatic liquids

TECHNIQUE INSTRUCTION: For each recipe, explicitly explain HOW these elements work together and WHEN to add each component for maximum flavor impact.
