Generate recipe ideas that:
1. MUST use ONLY the available ingredients listed above (plus pantry basics if flexibility allows)
2. Follow the ingredient flexibility guidelines strictly
3. Match the user's preferred cooking style
4. Can be completed with their available equipment
5. Fit within the time constraints
6. Focus on creative ways to combine ONLY the available ingredients

Be creative with combinations and cooking techniques. Focus on maximizing flavor from the available ingredients. Each recipe should be distinctly different in preparation method or flavor profile.

CRITICAL REMINDER: You MUST ONLY use the ingredients listed above. Do NOT suggest recipes with salmon, beef, pork, vegetables, or ANY other ingredients not explicitly listed. If the user only has "Chicken, chorizo, onion" then ALL recipes must use ONLY those three ingredients plus basic pantry staples.`;
